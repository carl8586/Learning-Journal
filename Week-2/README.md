# Learning Journal - Week 2

**Date:** 24 November 2024

## Learning Activities
This week I conducted a practical experiment on threat detection using AI to detect the attacks and their categories. This project aims to develop a robust threat detection system leveraging a Machine Learning Algorithm that enhances the system security.

## Resources
1. [Threat Detection In Cyber Security Using AI](https://github.com/yasakrami/Threat-Detection-in-Cyber-Security-Using-AI)

## Key Insights
1. **System's Process**: The project owner builds the threat detection system using machine learning algorithms to discover cyber threats. This project is based on the [CIC-IDS2017 database](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). The process consists of 5 parts:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involves preparing and modifying the raw data. We do this by handling the missing value, infinity value, normalization, and transforming categorical data to numerical data. 
   - **Attack Divisions**: The system categorizes different types of attacks (e.g., DDoS, Bot, Port Scan, Heartbleed).
   - **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features that are involved in attack detection. List out the top 20 features along with their percentages and visualize them using a bar plot. 
   - **Undersampling**: Balance the dataset if one of the classes has more samples than others.
   - **Apply Machine Learning Algorithms**: Train the model leveraging machine learning algorithms such as GaussianNB, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis, and MLPClassifier.

## Personal Reflection
This week, I gained valuable experiences from practicing and coding the system that helped me understand how the system works to detect cyber threats. I also encountered some difficulties such as Keyword Errors, code not working, and others. However, I overcame these issues and learned from them why solving them. In the coming week, I plan to: 
  - Read 2 papers related to cyber threat detection using AI

## Conclusion
To conclude this week, I have notably learned how to code the system using Jupyter and Python language. This journey helped me gain practical experiences that will consolidate my cybersecurity knowledge.
