# Learning Journal - Week 2

**Date:** 24 November 2024

## Learning Activities
For this week I did a practical experiment about threat detection using AI to detect the attack and its categories. This project develops a robust threat detection system leveraging a Machine Learning Algorithm that enhances the security of the internet.

## Resources
1. [Threat Detection In Cyber Security Using AI](https://github.com/yasakrami/Threat-Detection-in-Cyber-Security-Using-AI)

## Key Insights
1. **System's Process**: The project owner builds the threat detection system using machine learning algorithms to discover cyber threats. This project is based on the [CIC-IDS2017 database](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). The process contains 5 parts:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: The first part is to prepare and modify the raw data. We do this by handling the missing value, infinity value, normalization, and transforming categorical to numerical data. 
   - **Attack Divisions**: The system divides the different types of attacks into categories. (e.g., DDoS, Bot, Port Scan, Heartbleed)
   - **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features that are involved in attack detection. List out the top 20 features and their percentages and visualize them by a bar plot. 
   - **Undersampling**: Balance the dataset if one of the classes has more samples than others.
   - **Apply Machine Learning Algorithms**: Train the model leveraging machine learning algorithms such as GaussianNB, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis, and MLPClassifier.

## Personal Reflection
This week, I gained experiences from practicing and coding the system that helped me understand how the system works to detect cyber threats. In the coming week, I plan to: 
  - Read 2 papers related to cyber threat detection using AI

## Conclusion
To conclude this week, I have importantly learned how to code the system using Jupyter and Python language. This journey helped me gain practical experiences that will consolidate my cybersecurity knowledge.
