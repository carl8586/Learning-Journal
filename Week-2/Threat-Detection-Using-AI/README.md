## Overview

This project is based on the project "[Threat Detection In Cyber Security Using AI](https://github.com/yasakrami/Threat-Detection-in-Cyber-Security-Using-AI)", where I updated and simplified some code. The aim of this project is to develop a robust threat detection system using machine learning algorithms that enhance the defensive techniques of system security.

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

- Prepare and preprocess raw data for machine learning.
- Handle missing values and replace infinite values.
- Normalize and transform categorical data into numerical data.
- Utilize the dataset [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset).

### Step 2: Attack Division

- Categorize different types of attacks.
- Save these attacks for further analysis.
- Include 14 attack types.

### Step 3: Feature Selection

- Leverage files created in the previous step to perform feature selection.
- List the top 10 features along with their percentages.
- Visualize these features with a bar graph.

### Step 4: Undersampling

- Balance the dataset to prevent imbalances.
- Focus more on the minority class than the majority class.
- Reduce computational power to facilitate the process.

### Step 5: Machine Learning Algorithm Evaluation

- Involve algorithms such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and MLP Classifier.
- Calculate the accuracy of each machine learning algorithm.
