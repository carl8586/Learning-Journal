# Learning Journal - Week 1

**Date:** 17 November 2024

## Learning Activities Resources
This week I read the paper related to my research that provides vast information on how methodologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and metaheuristic algorithms augment the efficiency and accuracy of cyber threat detection.

## Resources
1. [Advancing cybersecurity: a comprehensive review of AI-driven detection techniques](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-024-00957-y)

## Key Insights
1. **Importance of AI in Cybersecurity**:
The article mentions that traditional methods such as firewalls and instruction detection systems are ineffective in defending against ever-evolving sophisticated cyber-attacks.
This leads to high false-positive rates, slower response time, and the demand for human intervention. However, methodologies such as AI, ML, DL, and metaheuristic algorithms promise
to enhance the defense and detection of the system by analyzing the vast datasets and accumulated past experiences.

2. **Methodologies**: The authors reviewed over sixty recent studies focusing on various AI techniques. They categorized these techniques into three main areas:
   - **Machine Learning**: An algorithm that allows the computer to analyze past data without programming which improves efficiency in data classification, processing,
     and anomalous threat detection.
   - **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural network that processes and learns vast amounts of data and past experiences, resulting in detecting anomalous
     and sophisticated patterns and actions.
   - **Metaheuristic Algorithms**: An algorithm that allows high efficiency and accuracy in the IDS by expanding the search space,
     resulting in the discovery of superior solutions for the ever-evolving attack patterns.

## Personal Reflection

The learning insights I gained from this paper help me understand the pivotal role AI plays in modern cybersecurity. In the coming week, I plan to:
  - Practicing AI-based threat detection techniques by reproducing a published experiment

## Conclusion

To summarize this week, I have significantly deepened my understanding of how AI and other methodologies are utilized in the field of cybersecurity. 
Through the in-depth reading of this paper, I have obtained a wealth of theoretical knowledge about the utilization of AI in cybersecurity.
